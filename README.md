# The Conservation Heroes Project

The [Smith Fellows Class of 2019](https://conbio.org/mini-sites/smith-fellows/meet-the-fellows/2019-fellows/) is initiating a project called the Conservation Heroes Campaign. The goal of this project is to highlight and amplify Conservation Heroes from the US to provide relatable role models to young people in under-served and under-represented communities. As part of our effort, we aim to crowdsource an inclusive and diverse database of people who represent diverse perspectives and experiences in conservation. 

For the first stage of this project, we are developing a geo-referenced website that highlights these individuals or organizations and their stories along with photographs. In the coming months, we will be expanding this work by employing artists to create detailed illustrations and free educational resources.

We are soliciting nominations of conservation scientists, practitioners, community organizers, advocates, and organizations who represent a diversity of identities, including but not limited to: race, ethnic heritage, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation and physical ability. Self nominations are welcome!

Watch this space for updates on our nomination process and website. Email `Cons.Heroes.Campaign@gmail.com` for more information or to inquire about the nomination process.
